# **ABC Company Employee Data Analysis**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project analyzes employee data from ABC Company to extract key insights about workforce distribution, salary trends, and correlations between various factors. The analysis involves preprocessing the dataset, conducting statistical evaluations, and visualizing the findings using Python.

## **ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information**
- **Rows:** 458
- **Columns:** 9
- **Features Include:** Employee Team, Position, Age, Salary, Height, etc.

## **ðŸ”§ Preprocessing Steps**
1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Missing salary values were replaced with the median salary.
2. **Correcting Data Errors:**
   - The "Height" column was replaced with random values between 150 and 180 cm.
3. **Ensuring Data Consistency:**
   - Checked for duplicates and removed inconsistencies in categorical values.

## **ðŸ“Š Analysis Tasks**
1. **Employee Distribution Across Teams:**
   - Determined the number of employees in each team and calculated the percentage split.
2. **Employee Segregation by Position:**
   - Categorized employees based on their job roles.
3. **Predominant Age Group Analysis:**
   - Identified the most common age group within the company.
4. **Salary Expenditure by Team & Position:**
   - Analyzed which teams and job roles contribute most to salary costs.
5. **Correlation Between Age & Salary:**
   - Evaluated the relationship between age and salary to identify trends.

## **ðŸ“ˆ Graphical Representations**
Each analysis task is accompanied by a visualization for better understanding:
- **Bar Charts** for employee distribution by team and position.
- **Pie Chart** for the percentage of employees in different teams.
- **Histogram** for age group distribution.
- **Box Plot** for salary expenditure by team and position.
- **Scatter Plot** for correlation analysis between age and salary.

## **ðŸ“¢ Key Insights**
- **Most employees belong to Teams A & B**, while some teams have significantly fewer members.
- **Mid-level positions dominate** the workforce, with fewer employees in senior roles.
- The **age group 25-35 years** is the most common, highlighting a young workforce.
- **Team A and senior positions** contribute to the highest salary expenditure.
- There is a **positive correlation between age and salary**, indicating experience-based pay growth.

## **ðŸš€ Conclusion & Recommendations**
âœ… **Balance workforce allocation** across teams to optimize efficiency.
âœ… **Develop leadership training programs** to ensure career progression opportunities.
âœ… **Encourage mentorship programs** to transfer knowledge between younger and senior employees.
âœ… **Ensure fair salary growth policies** across all job levels.
